data must the decompressed on the main folder
mangadisponible must be on the main folder
You need to creat a new folder named manga and send config.dat in this new one

For update manga database:
-> compile 1st script
-> run this script on a manga's folder
-> Creat a SDL project & add SDL_Image
-> compile 2nd script
-> run the new script in a folder w/ the new config.dat & all manga's page
-> Change the folder name in a "Chapitre_chapiternumber" (chapitre and not chapiter)
-> move this folder in a new folder on the main one. Call this new folder 'Update'
-> add to mangadisponible your manga name w/ '_' for spaces, abbreviation for the manga and the state (1: in progress, 2: Finish/Abandoned, 3: One-shot)
-> move this new mangadisponible version into Update
-> compile the last script (update)
-> run it in the update folder
-> launch The Restorator
-> the manga in now alvailable inside the restorator

-> for any issue, notify me
